      Modded Minecraft Club is a public network of community oriented modded
      Minecraft Servers. We currently have a Age of Engineering, FTB Beyond, and
      Mindcrack 1.4.7 server. These servers are run by our excellent staff, some of
      whom have played Minecraft since it was a free web browser game.
    </p>
    <p class="main-paragraph">
      Our goal with MMCC is to create a mid-sized, fun, and healthy community
      around our shared interest of modded Minecraft. To accomplish this goal
      all griefing is forbidden, we have a no-whitelist policy, and we strive to
      ensure the technical aspects of the server run smoothly.

            Here at MMCC we have a no-whitelist policy. That is, any player
            can join the server; no application, no hassle. Whitelists are
            ineffective at preventing bad guys from getting in and add hassle
            for legitimate players. Instead, we implement a system
            where players gain the Member rank after spending some time on the
            server and building basic machines.

            MMCC runs on a single very powerful dedicated server located in
            Montreal, Canada. This server has an i7-4790k, 32 GB of RAM,
            a 250 mbps guarenteed internet speed, and a 250 GB server grade SSD. At
            MMCC, lag won't be an issue.

            We want MMCC to be a healthy, but also free community. As such, we
            implement rules where neccessary, but only when neccessary. Our
            rules establish a grief-free and respectful environment. You may
            read the full rules on our website at wiki.moddedminecraft.club.

            Here at MMCC we do our best to avoid banning items, although due to
            the nature of modded Minecraft, sometimes we have no choice but to issue item bans. 
            Offline chunkloaders are banned in order to ensure constant smooth performance,
            and we have a custom plugin for online loading. We only ban items that have a large 
            performance impact or could ruin another player's experience.

      At this point, hopefully you can't wait to get started with MMCC! We
      currently have three servers: an FTB Beyond server, a Mindcrack 1.4.7 server, and
      an Age of Engineering server. To join all you need to do is download one of
      these packs in the FTB or Curse Launcher then join with one of the
      following IP addresses:
